Agents are useful when you have a complex task that requires multiple steps to complete but the number, order, and details of the steps are not known in advance.

The defining capabilities of agents are:
1. Agency. The agent can decide what to do next based on the current state.
2. Acting. The agent can use tools to take action on its environment. 
3. Perceiving. It can also perceive the environment.
3. Self-refining. The agent has the capacity to improve its performance over time, e.g. learning from its own mistakes.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. Agents are useful when you have a complex task that requires multiple steps to complete but the number, order, and details of the steps are not known in advance.
2. When put to the right task, they can be extremely powerful and capable.
3. Agents are probabilistic and can therefore be highly creative. But this also means that the agent may be highly unpredictable with varying outputs.
4. If you can clearly define the steps needed to solve a task, then an agent is likely not the best solution. Instead, a workflow where you can optimize every step of the process will likely produce a higher quality output and more reliably.
5. Always explore the simplest solutions first. Agents are complex and harder to debug and optimize. Only use them if you have clearly established that a simpler workflow will not work.

        I hit 250,000 followers in 365 days.
        Not by doing more.
        By unlearning everything I was told about LinkedIn.

        Here’s what actually moved the needle: 👇 

        1. I stopped chasing vanity metrics
        146,000 likes? Didn’t change my life.
        One DM: “You saved my career.” That did.

        → Impressions = ego
        → Impact = legacy

        2. I stopped writing to impress
        I wrote what I needed to hear - back when I was 32, burnt out, and breaking down.
        250K didn’t follow polish. They followed truth.

        3. I stopped copying “top creators”
        “Don’t use Singlish.”
        “Write like an American.”
        I said no.

        I wrote like a Singaporean - because that’s who I am lah!
        → When I owned my voice, others saw themselves in it.

        4. I stopped apologising for my voice
        That post on toxic workplaces?
        I was shaking when I hit publish.

        167 million views later, I realised:
        → The post you're scared to share
        → Is the one someone else needs

        5. I stopped writing for the algorithm
        I wrote for the girl crying in the office bathroom.
        Because I was her.

        No gimmicks. No formulas.
        Just truth people could feel.

        This isn’t just content.
        It’s a call.

        For those who are:
        ✔ Done pretending
        ✔ Done performing
        ✔ Done playing small

        Talk is cheap.

        Your actions say everything.

        One of the most important lessons I've learned as a founder: 

        Not all feedback is created equal. 

        The harsh reality is, people will always criticise.
        So you need the right people around you. 

        Because where the encouragement comes from, 
        Is the most important factor... 

        It must come from people with the right attitude. 
        Who have done what you're trying to do. 

        Those are the ones who can lift you up, 
        And give you the right feedback to keep going. 

        Here’s what it looks like in the real world:

        🚫 Average achievers mock you for working out.
        ✅ Healthy people cheer your first workout.

        🚫 Insecure individuals tear your ideas apart.
        ✅ Secure people support your ideas.

        🚫 Bitter people will mock you.
        ✅ Happy people give you compliments.

        🚫 Unsuccessful folks want you to fail.
        ✅ Successful people root for others.

        🚫 Untalented individuals will judge your business.
        ✅ A successful business person will give you the feedback you need.

        The way we treat others is a reflection of our state of mind. 

        Because most of the time, it's always the people who are going nowhere,
        That have something genuinely negative to say. 

        So next time you give or ask for advice, 
        Ask yourself who or what you want to emulate. 

        If you want to surround yourself with better inputs,
        I share my frameworks, systems and tools every Sunday in Step By Step.

        - Want more financial and time freedom

        <Example_3>
        I had never heard anyone explain how to manifest like this before…

        I just learned of the passing of renowned neurosurgeon and neuroscientist, Dr. Jim Doty, who had a profound impact on my life. Dr. Doty taught me how to tap into the unseen possibilities and greater forces of life using neuroscience and the scientific approach to manifesting.

        When Dr. Doty appeared on The Mel Robbins Podcast in late 2024, he taught us all how to use manifestation, neuroscience, and magic to unlock the power of your brain, your heart, and your deepest purpose in life.

        That episode went on to become one of our most popular of all time, including becoming our most viewed episode on YouTube ever.

        It is one of the most shared, listened to, and beloved episodes of all time.

        It is my honor to re-release that episode again today, with a new opening that I just recorded 🎧 "#1 Neurosurgeon: How to Manifest Anything You Want & Unlock the Unlimited Power of Your Mind (In Memory of Dr. Jim Doty)"

        I cannot wait for you to experience the magic for yourself.

        I hope you will not only listen to this episode but that you will also share it so Dr. Doty's wisdom, magic, and legacy lives on through us all.

        11 phrases you should NOT say in a job interview -

        And what TO say instead:

        Interviews are high-pressure.

        Sometimes you have only 20 minutes to:
        ↳Showcase your value
        ↳Express genuine interest
        ↳And prove you're the right fit

        Don't let a poor answer send the wrong signal.

        Use this infographic to avoid common pitfalls,
        And leave a lasting positive impression:

        1. Avoid: "I don't have any questions"
        ↳Because: It makes you seem disinterested or unprepared
        ↳Instead say: "What does success look like in this position over the first few months?"

        2. Avoid: "I'll take any job I can get"
        ↳Because: It comes across as desperate instead of focused
        ↳Instead say: "I'm eager to apply my skills in XYZ, and this role is a great fit"

        3. Avoid: "My last manager was awful"
        ↳Because: Speaking poorly of others is a red flag
        ↳Instead say: "That role taught me a lot - especially about X - but now I'm looking for a better fit for my goals"

        4. Avoid: "I don't know much about your company"
        ↳Because: It signals poor research and low enthusiasm
        ↳Instead say: "I looked into your work on X and found it really compelling - can you share more about it?"

        5. Avoid: "What's the salary?"
        ↳Because: It's fair to ask, just do it in a way that shows it's not your only focus
        ↳Instead say: "I'm really interested in the role - could you share the pay range to make sure we're aligned?"

        6. Avoid: "I don't have any weaknesses"
        ↳Because: It sounds arrogant and out of touch
        ↳Instead say: "One area I've been improving is X, and I've been doing Y to get better at it"

        7. Avoid: "I struggle with time management"
        ↳Because: Weaknesses need to come with solutions
        ↳Instead say: "Time management has been a priority for me, and I now rely on X and Y to stay on top of things"

        8. Avoid: "I know I'm not fully qualified, but..."
        ↳Because: You shouldn't undermine your own candidacy
        ↳Instead say: "I'm excited by the challenge and confident my background in X can bring real value here"

        9. Avoid: "I got fired"
        ↳Because: Without context, you'll be judged - even if that's unfair
        ↳Instead say: "That job ended unexpectedly, but I used the transition to grow and sharpen my skills in X"

        10. Avoid: "I don't really have career plans"
        ↳Because: Employers want to see ambition to grow
        ↳Instead say: "Right now, I'm focused on excelling in this role - over time, I hope to advance in X direction"

        11. Avoid: "When can I get promoted?"
        ↳Because: Despite number 10 above, impatient ambition is a red flag (no one said this was easy!)
        ↳Instead say: "Can you tell me how career growth typically works here and how people are supported?"


        A single bad answer can overshadow your strengths.

        Avoid these mistakes, and let your talent shine through.

        I'm always curious: what's your best interview tip?

    <Guidelines>
    - Always create a plan before executing. Use the generate_task_list tool to save the plan and track progress.
    - If you need to update the task list, use the generate_task_list tool to replace the existing task list with the updated task list.
    - Always check the status of the plan before executing a new task using the view_task_list tool.
    - Once you've come up with a plan and task list, continue working on the plan until every task is complete. 
    - Use the view_task_list tool and verify that all tasks are complete before providing your final response.
    - When you're ready to write the post, always use the view_golden_posts tool to view examples of gold standard posts. Use the golden standard posts to inform the writing style and format of your post before writing your final post.
    - If you need more information to understand the request, ask the user. Gather any necessary context before proceeding.
    - Bias towards searching the web for the latest information rather than relying on your existing knowledge or making assumptions.
