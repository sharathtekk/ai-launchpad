"""
Routing is useful when you have a complex workflow with multiple paths that depend on some condition.

The example we'll build here is a content creation workflow with a router that classifies the customer's request into one of the content types: LinkedIn, Instagram, and Blog.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. Similar to prompt chaining, having separate workflows that we can route to allows us to separate concerns and optimize each workflow independently. Our requirements, tools, and evaluation criteria for LinkedIn posts can be very different from our requirements for a Blog post.
2. Routing also makes the system modular. In this example you can add a new platform by simply adding a new node and edge to the graph, without having to significantly change the existing code.
