"""
Short-term memory can be thought of as the working memory of an agent within a single conversation. Typically this just means the conversation history.

## Agent Loops
- This is a simplified example just to show you the mechanics of cycling through a back-and-forth conversation. It's more of a chatbot and it can only respond so it doesn't really have agency yet.
- A complete agent loop will include tool calling: the agent will be able to take actions in its environment, perceive the results, and then decide what to do next. In other words, it will have agency.

See the `Agents` section for more information.
