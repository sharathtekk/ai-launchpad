"""
Retrieval is the process of retrieving context to incorporate into an LLM or AI agent conversation.

There are many ways to implement retrieval. In this tutorial, we will cover the most common method which involves using a vector database. This example shows how we can give an agent access to a product database.

## Retrieval with Vector Databases
- Vector databases are a type of database that stores data as vectors.
- Vectors are a numerical representation of data. In the context of AI, vectors are typically used to represent text or images.
- Vector databases are used for similarity search. This means finding the most similar vectors to a given query vector.
- Chroma is a popular open-source vector database.
